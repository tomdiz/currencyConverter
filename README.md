# currencyConverter
CBS Interactive - Coding Sample Problem

Please write an Objective-C app that:
• Runs on an iOS device or in Simulator
• Converts a user-entered number from one currency to another
• Does not use third-party source code (for example, code found on github)
• Include support for all orientations.

Some other things you may consider implementing:
• Multiple conversions (from one currency into multiple)
• Images (such as a picture of the currency or a country flag)
• Formatted values to account for currency symbols, positive and negative amounts, and so on • Real-time currency conversion rates
